# SI568 Course Project(Word Adventure Game based on ChatGPT API)
For more detail, please look at the [Project Report](si568_project_report_leczhang.pdf).

## Abstract
My project develops a word adventure game based on the generative OpenAI API. It is an open world game, but the world is restricted by a series of world settings, such as the final boss, the secret of the world, the capacity of player, and etc. The world is full of NPCs of different identities and personalities, and players can either talk to them to get useful information or turn against them. Any behaviors of player will lead to different possibilities. Players only need to obey the basic rules, which means they are free to create their own story line. They can either be an kind traveler or a fierce ruffian, depending on what they did and what they said.

## Required Packages
* Python 3.9
* Openai 0.27.4
